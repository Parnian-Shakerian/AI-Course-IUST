# Artificial Intelligence Projects

The projects focus on AI concepts and algorithms, providing experience in building and evaluating intelligent systems.

## Projects Overview

### Search Algorithms
- Solved classic AI problems such as the 8-Queens Problem.
- Implemented search techniques including Uniform Cost Search (UCS), A*, and Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP).

### Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Built SVM models for supervised classification tasks.
- Explored kernel functions to handle non-linear data.
- Analyzed the impact of hyperparameters on classification performance.

### Neural Networks
- Designed and implemented neural network models for pattern recognition tasks.
- Trained models using backpropagation and gradient-based optimization methods.

## Repository Structure

Each project is organized in its own directory and typically includes:
- Code: Source files implementing the algorithms and models.
- Documentation: Descriptions of project objectives, approaches, and implementation details.
- Reports: Analysis of results, challenges encountered, and key learnings.
